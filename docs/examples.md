# Examples

There are multiple examples for cubes and shared dimensions in the [example](../example) folder. They usually consist of the following files:

- .csv file for the tabular data
- .yml file for the description of the cube
- .py file for running `pylindas`
- .ttl file as output after running `pylindas`

For some examples, there are also files for different concepts.
